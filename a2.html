          <img src="imgs/a2/q3.png" style="width: 25vw">
          <p>This image worked best with a threshold of 56. Although it does not clearly show the words <br>
            anymore, a higher threshold would result in a creeping black background from right to left.</p>

        </td>

        <td><h3>Question 4</h3>
          <img src="imgs/a2/q4.jpg" style="width: 25vw">
          <p>The best threshold was 115. If a higher threshold is used, the writing could become <br>
             a bit more visible, but dark spots would slowly appear as you slide it up.</p>

      <tr>
      <td><h3>Question 5</h3>
        <img src="imgs/a2/q5.png" style="width: 25vw">
        <p>The black rectangle boundary becomes white and only the outer edge of it is left / detected. <br>
        Then on the inside of the rectangle where the grey meets the black outer part another line / edge is found and left.<br>
        Lastly, the lines forming the X turn into a border in the shape of the X with white now inside.</p>

      </td>


      <td><h3>Question 6</h3>
        <img src="imgs/a2/q6.png" style="width: 25vw">
        <p>The first thing I tried was the noise reduction filter in photoshop cs2 (Left).<br>
          This one was not very effective as the most I was able to do was make the image more blurry. <br>
          The method fails to remove the specks from around the screen.<br>
          Next, I tried using gimps noise reduction filter (right). This one worked great and although it did make the image a bit blurry,<br>
          it was effective in removing virtually all the spots across the image. Some parts of the image seemed to get blurry as well,<br>
          but this was a result of the method blending the noise into the background.<br>
